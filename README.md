tweetnet
========

 - stream\_consumer python module for consumption of twitter stream

 - webapp is a basic flask app for flag and game control

 - .tweetnet is a file that should contain required environment variables for storing auth
   we don't check them into git, for obvious reason. Get them from another team member.

 - requirements.txt has all the requirements, do a `virtualenv env && source env/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt`
